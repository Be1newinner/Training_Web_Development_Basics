Here are 10 basic JavaScript loop questions:

1. **Print numbers 1 to 10:**

   - Write a loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10 to the console.

2. **Print even numbers from 1 to 20:**

   - Write a loop that prints all even numbers between 1 and 20.

3. **Sum of first 10 natural numbers:**

   - Write a loop to find the sum of the first 10 natural numbers (1 to 10).

4. **Print elements of an array:**

   - Given an array `const arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];`, write a loop to print all elements of the array.

5. **Reverse an array:**

   - Given an array `const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`, write a loop to print the array elements in reverse order.

6. **Count occurrences of a letter in a string:**

   - Given a string `const str = "javascript";`, write a loop to count how many times the letter 'a' appears in the string.

7. **Factorial of a number:**

   - Write a loop to calculate the factorial of a given number `n`.

8. **Find the maximum number in an array:**

   - Given an array `const arr = [5, 12, 8, 20, 7];`, write a loop to find the maximum number in the array.

9. **Print a multiplication table:**

   - Write a loop to print the multiplication table for a given number `n`.

10. **Sum of elements in an array:**
    - Given an array `const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`, write a loop to calculate the sum of all elements in the array.

These questions should help you practice fundamental looping concepts in JavaScript.
